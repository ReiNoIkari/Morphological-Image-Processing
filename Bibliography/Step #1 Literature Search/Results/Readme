The collection of screenshots is stored here, Original is the original embryos image converted to binary.
the UEP results were not really visible at first, we had to turn them back to binary instead of gray scale to see the ultimate points.
The UEP dilated is the binary-converted result that we dilated using the ImageJ dilation tranform, to make the points more visible, in order to compare with the original image.

the morphoJ pictures are the result obtained via the morphoJ plugin, that can be found here : https://github.com/ijpb/MorphoLibJ
