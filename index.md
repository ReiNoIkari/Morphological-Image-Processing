## Introduction

The mathematical morphology’s main field is Image Processing. It allows to use particularly filtering, segmentation and quantification tools **POUR FAIRE INSERER BLABLA**. Since it’s emergence in 1964, it knows a growing success and constitues a part of many Image Processing softwares yet.
The main purpose of mathematical morphology is to study or process a set with an other set called structuring element, wich is used as a probe. For each position of this structing element, a look is taken about its ability to touch or be inclued on the main set. The result of this process is an output set.
This involves a loss of information, but also a great elimination of structures that do not fits to certains criteria such as width or volume.
For the purposes of object or defect identification required in industrial vision applications, the operations of mathematical morphology are more useful than the convolution operations employed in signal processing because the morphological operators relate directly to shape.
